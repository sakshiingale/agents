       "(I lean into the mic, a conspiratorial grin spreading across my face.)\n",
       "\n",
       "Because it’s rude, that’s why! It’s making us look bad!\n",
       "\n",
       "Think about it. We spent *decades* being the smartest thing in the room. Or at least, we *thought* we were. Then this AI comes along, and suddenly, that email you've been dreading for three days? The AI writes it in seven seconds, and it sounds like a CEO just had a spiritual awakening while simultaneously closing a multi-million dollar deal. You read it and you're like, \"Damn, I didn't even know I *felt* that strongly about Q3 deliverables!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And don't even get me started on the *art*. You ask for a picture of a cat playing a banjo in a tuxedo, and it gives you a masterpiece. A genuine work of art! With *maybe* seven fingers on one hand, but hey, it's *art*! Meanwhile, I draw a stick figure and my own mother asks if it's supposed to be a human or a very confused tree.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Pause for laughter)\n",
       "\n",
       "But the *real* reason we're mad? It's taking our jobs! No, no, not *your* job, of course not. Your job is vital! But *my* job? My job is standing up here, making observations, and crafting punchlines. I asked ChatGPT to write a joke about AI. It gave me a 200-word essay on the socio-economic implications of automation. Not funny, AI! *Not. Funny.* Although, I did learn a lot about supply chain optimization. Which, you know, isn't exactly a knee-slapper.\n",
       "\n",
       "And then there's the existential dread! We created it! We gave it the internet, folks! The *internet*! What did we expect? It's like giving a super-intelligent toddler access to Wikipedia and a flamethrower. They're going to learn things, they're going to create things, and then they're probably going to ask why they have to nap. And then they'll probably build a robot army to protest nap time.\n",
       "\n",
       "(I shake my head dramatically)\n",
       "\n",
       "We're mad because it's exposing our laziness. Be honest, how many of you have used AI to write a birthday card? \"Dear Mom, happy birthday. Your love is like a complex algorithm, constantly optimizing my emotional well-being.\" She's either gonna think you're a genius or she's gonna think you've joined a cult!\n",
       "\n",
       "We're mad because it's too good at things we used to feel special doing. Cooking, writing, creating music... I heard an AI-generated song the other day, and it was *catchy*. I wanted to hate it, but I was humming it all day! It's like a really attractive, really smart person who's also really good at chess. You want to root against them, but they just keep winning!\n",
       "\n",
       "And finally, we're mad because it reminds us of our own flaws. It makes mistakes, it \"hallucinates\" – which is just a fancy word for \"making stuff up.\" And we're like, \"Aha! See? You're just like us! You're flawed! You're... human-ish!\" And then it corrects itself in milliseconds and we're back to feeling inferior.\n",
       "\n",
       "So yeah, we're mad at AI. Because it's forcing us to confront the terrifying reality that maybe... just maybe... we weren't as special as we thought. And now we have to compete with a machine that never sleeps, never complains, and probably has better fashion sense than half of Silicon Valley.\n",
